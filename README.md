# Roll the dice and Win

Player who scores a total of 100 points will win the game!

- Starting the game with player 1
  - Player 1 rolls the dice, dice value will be added to the current score
  - If the rolled value is a 1, current score will be lost and the game will switch to player 2
  - Player can hold their current score at any point in time, and the score held will be added to the total score.
  - Player who reaches 100 first will be the winner.
- Same steps for player 2 as well.
